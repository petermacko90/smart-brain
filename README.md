This application was a part of an online course at [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-developer-in-2018/).

The changes/additions I've made:
- app shows all the faces on a picture instead of just the first one
- after signing out, the Sign in form is shown instead of Register
- new component Notification which displays textual messages/warnings
- this Notification displays when user submits empty image URL or the image URL is incorrect
- display Notification warning on empty inputs on Register and Sign in
- display Notification after unsuccessful Register or Sign in
- submits forms on pressing Enter on Register and Sign in inputs
- autofocus on first inputs of Register and Sign in
- increase the entry count only on successful image submissions
